    A string is made up of Unicodes, but there's also the concept of Character
    A Character is what a human would perceive to be a single lexical character
    For example, cafÃ© might be 5 Unicodes, but it's 4 Characters.
 You can access any character in a String using [] notation, But the indexes inside the [] are not Int, they are a type called String.Index
